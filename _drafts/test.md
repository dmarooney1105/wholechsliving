  I’ll never forget the first time I heard about cryotherapy. It was when I
  watching E News and hearing the latest on Lindsay Lohan’s weight loss updates.
  Apparently, she was one of Hollywood’s first to try out cryotherapy.  “You can
  burn 600 calories in 3 minutes with temperatures below 200 degrees F!”… um
  WHAT! I immediately googled more about it and was intrigued but turned off
  because I HATE being cold.
